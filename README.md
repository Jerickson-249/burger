# Eat-A-Burger Application
A Burger Eating Application

## Description of Project

This project is designed to illustrate the MVC development method. I am learning and expanding my knowledge about express.js and rendering engines. 

This app has basic styling and a layout rendered using Handlebars in HTML. 

It shows the following:

1) A list of desired burgers to be eaten

2) An interface to show the burgers as eaten

3) A list to show to show the burgers that have already been eaten.

The burgers are stored in a MySQL database and the results are rendered using the table in the database. 

The primary challenge was building out the ORM. I used the examples from the Cats App example in class for most of my code as it was a fully functional model in the end.
